## Introduction

### Motivation

Vision-based robotic manipulation is a fundamental challenge in robotics, combining computer vision and control. Traditional approaches use precise position feedback from sensors, but real-world applications require learning from visual observations.

This project demonstrates:
1. Training a vision system (YOLO) to detect objects with sub-centimeter accuracy
2. Using detected object coordinates for reinforcement learning
3. Achieving high success rates with reward shaping and collision avoidance

### Problem Statement

**Task**: Train a 2-link robotic arm to reach a randomly placed red box using only visual detection.

**Constraints**:
- Box position detected once per episode (realistic for real robots)
- Must use fingertip, not arm links
- Must handle detection noise
- Fast training (< 1 hour on consumer hardware)

### Environment

**MuJoCo Reacher Environment**:
- **Robot**: 2-link planar arm (shoulder + elbow)
- **Action Space**: 2D continuous joint torques [-1, 1]
- **Observation Space**: 8D vector [cos(θ1), sin(θ1), cos(θ2), sin(θ2), θ̇1, θ̇2, x_box, y_box]
- **Episode Length**: Max 50 steps
- **Success Criterion**: Fingertip within 2cm of box center

### Phase 2: Reinforcement Learning with SAC

#### Reward Function Design

Multi-component reward function encourages desired behavior:

```python
R_total = R_distance + R_collision + R_time + R_control + R_success

Components:
1. Distance reward: -10 × ||p_fingertip - p_target||
   → Primary learning signal (dense)

2. Collision penalty: -10 if arm links touch target
   → Encourages using fingertip

3. Time penalty: -0.1 per step
   → Encourages faster reaching

4. Control penalty: -0.01 × ||action||²
   → Encourages smooth movements

5. Success bonus: 10 + 0.2 × (50 - t) if within 2cm
   → Sparse reward at episode end
   → Time bonus for faster reaching
```

**Reward Function Evolution**:

*Initial Design (V0)*: Simple distance-based reward
- Issue: No collision avoidance
- Result: Agent pushed box with arm links

*Iteration 1*: Added harsh collision penalty (-50)
- Issue: Agent learned to avoid box entirely
- Result: Success rate declined from 15% → 4%

*Final Design (V2)*: Reduced collision penalty to -10
- Result: Balanced exploration and safety
- Achievement: **85% → 94% success rate**

## Analysis

### What Worked Well

1. **YOLO Accuracy**:
   - 99.5% mAP exceeds expectations
   - 0.26mm coordinate error is 76× better than success threshold
   - Fast inference (60 FPS) enables real-time control

2. **Reward Shaping**:
   - Multi-component reward balances multiple objectives
   - Collision penalty (-10) allows exploration while discouraging bad behavior
   - Time bonus encourages efficiency without sacrificing accuracy

3. **Training Optimizations**:
   - 4 parallel environments: 4× sample efficiency
   - Initial collision check: Prevents invalid episodes
   - MPS acceleration: Fast training on consumer hardware (M2 GPU)
   - Float32 precision: Stable training with MPS

4. **Two-Stage Approach**:
   - Decoupling vision and control simplifies debugging
   - YOLO trained separately ensures reliable detection
   - SAC focuses purely on control policy

### Challenges and Solutions

#### Challenge 1: Collision Reward Too Harsh

**Problem**: Initial collision penalty (-50) caused agent to avoid box entirely
**Symptom**: Success rate declined from 15% → 4% during training
**Root Cause**: Penalty dominated reward signal, agent preferred safety over reaching

**Solution**: Reduced penalty to -10
**Result**: Balanced exploration and safety, 85% → 94% success rate

**Lesson**: Reward scaling critical for multi-objective tasks

#### Challenge 2: MPS Float64 Incompatibility

**Problem**: Apple M2 GPU (MPS) doesn't support float64
**Symptom**: `TypeError: Cannot convert MPS Tensor to float64`
**Impact**: Training crash

**Solution**: 
- Changed observation space to float32
- Converted all numpy arrays to float32
- Updated YOLO wrapper to return float32

**Result**: Stable training on M2 GPU
**Benefit**: 2-3× speedup vs CPU

#### Challenge 3: Initial Collision Spawns

**Problem**: Box occasionally spawned in contact with arm links
**Impact**: Invalid episodes, agent learned from bad initial states
**Detection**: Custom test script found ~5% collision rate

**Solution**: 
- Added collision check in `reset_model()`
- Up to 100 respawn attempts per reset
- Only accept valid configurations

**Result**: 0% initial collisions in 100 test resets
**Impact**: +9% success rate improvement

#### Challenge 4: Evaluation During Training Overhead

**Initial Approach**: Evaluate every 5K steps (10 episodes each)
**Problem**: Evaluation adds ~10% training overhead
**Consideration**: Disable for faster training?

**Decision**: Keep evaluation enabled
**Rationale**:
- Tracks learning progress in real-time
- Saves best model (critical for performance)
- Overhead acceptable (5.5 min over 55 min training)

**Result**: Best model saved at 100K steps (higher success than final model)

### Limitations

1. **Single Object**: Only detects red boxes, not generalizable to other objects
2. **Fixed Camera**: Top-down view required, not robust to camera pose changes
3. **2D Planar Arm**: Simplified task compared to 6-DOF industrial robots
4. **Synthetic Data**: YOLO trained only on simulated images
5. **Deterministic Environment**: No dynamics randomization or domain randomization

### Success Factors

**Why This Approach Works**:

1. **Accurate Vision**: 0.26mm YOLO error is negligible for 2cm task
2. **Dense + Sparse Rewards**: Distance signal guides learning, success bonus reinforces good episodes
3. **Exploration**: Entropy maximization (SAC) explores multiple strategies
4. **Sample Efficiency**: Off-policy learning + replay buffer + parallel envs
5. **Hardware Acceleration**: M2 GPU enables fast iteration

**Key Design Decisions**:

- YOLOv10-small: Balance between accuracy and speed
- 416×416 images: Smaller than 640×640, faster training
- SAC vs PPO: Off-policy more sample-efficient
- 4 parallel envs: Sweet spot for M2 GPU memory
- Float32: Required for MPS, no accuracy loss
