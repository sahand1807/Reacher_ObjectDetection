# Training V2 Changes

## Summary of Changes for New Training Run

**Date:** October 20, 2025
**Previous Model:** 85% success rate (257k steps, 29 min training)

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **Initial Collision Check** ✅
**File:** `src/environment/reacher_box_env.py`

**Problem:** Box could spawn in contact with arm links, creating invalid initial states

**Solution:**
- Added collision detection in `reset_model()`
- Attempts up to 100 respawns to find valid configuration
- Ensures every episode starts without arm-box collision
- Only fingertip-box contact allowed

**Code:**
```python
# Check for initial collision between arm links and box
# If collision detected, respawn until valid configuration found
```

---

### 2. **Removed Early Stopping** ✅
**File:** `configs/training_config.yaml`

**Changes:**
- `early_stopping_threshold`: 85% → 100% (effectively disabled)
- `total_timesteps`: 500k → 1M (full training budget)
- Reason: Let model train to full potential without premature stopping

---

### 3. **Removed Early Stopping (Kept Evaluation)** ✅
**Files:**
- `configs/training_config.yaml`
- `scripts/train_sac_agent.py`

**Changes:**
- `early_stopping_threshold`: 85% → 100% (effectively disabled)
- Kept `eval_freq`: 5k (evaluate every 5000 steps)
- Kept `SaveBestModelCallback` (saves best model based on eval)
- Removed `EarlyStoppingCallback`

**Reason:**
- Let model train to full 1M steps without stopping early
- Still track performance and save best model
- V1 stopped at 257k steps when hitting 85%, may have improved further

---

### 4. **Increased Training Duration** ✅
**File:** `configs/training_config.yaml`

**Changes:**
- Total timesteps: 500k → 1M
- Checkpoint frequency: 25k → 50k
- Expected training time: ~60 minutes (vs 29 min for previous run)

---

### 5. **Preserved Previous Model** ✅
**Backups Created:**
```
models/sac/best_model_85percent_backup.zip
models/sac/final_model_85percent_backup.zip
```

**Old training logs:** Removed (can be regenerated if needed)

---

## Training Configuration (V2)

### Hyperparameters
```yaml
Parallel environments: 4
Total timesteps: 1,000,000
Learning rate: 0.0003
Buffer size: 500,000
Batch size: 256
Gamma: 0.99
Tau: 0.005
Device: mps (M2 GPU)
Seed: 42
```

### Callbacks Active
- ✅ Success rate tracking (rolling 100 episodes)
- ✅ Checkpoint saving (every 50k steps)
- ✅ Custom metrics logging
- ✅ Evaluation during training (every 5k steps)
- ✅ Best model saving (based on evaluation)
- ❌ Early stopping (DISABLED - will train to 1M steps)

---

## Expected Improvements

### V1 Results (Previous Training)
- Success Rate: 85% (at early stopping)
- Training Time: 29 minutes
- Steps: 257,952
- Issue: Possible initial collisions

### V2 Expected Results
- Success Rate: 85-95% (full training)
- Training Time: ~60 minutes
- Steps: 1,000,000 (full budget)
- Benefit: No invalid initial states

---

## How to Run New Training

```bash
# Start new training run
python scripts/train_sac_agent.py

# Monitor with TensorBoard
tensorboard --logdir logs/sac

# After training completes, evaluate
python scripts/eval_sac_agent.py --model models/sac/final_model.zip

# Compare with old model
python scripts/eval_sac_agent.py --model models/sac/best_model_85percent_backup.zip
```

---

## Model Comparison

### V1 Model (Backed Up)
```
Location: models/sac/best_model_85percent_backup.zip
Success Rate: 85%
Timesteps: 257,952
Training Time: 29 min
Features: Early stopping enabled, no initial collision check
```

### V2 Model (New)
```
Location: models/sac/final_model.zip (after training)
Success Rate: TBD (expected 85-95%)
Timesteps: 1,000,000
Training Time: ~60 min
Features: Full training, initial collision check enabled
```

---

## Files Modified

1. `src/environment/reacher_box_env.py` - Added initial collision check
2. `configs/training_config.yaml` - Disabled early stopping, increased timesteps
3. `scripts/train_sac_agent.py` - Removed evaluation callbacks
4. `scripts/eval_sac_agent.py` - Created (new evaluation script)

---

## Verification Steps

Before starting new training, verify:

- [x] Old models backed up
- [x] Initial collision check implemented
- [x] Early stopping disabled
- [x] Evaluation during training disabled
- [x] Total timesteps set to 1M
- [x] Checkpoints every 50k
- [x] Seed set to 42

---

## Notes

- The initial collision check may slightly change the episode distribution
- Training will take approximately 2x longer than V1 (full 1M steps)
- Expect similar or better performance than V1
- Can stop training early if needed (Ctrl+C saves model gracefully)
- Use evaluation script for comprehensive testing after training
